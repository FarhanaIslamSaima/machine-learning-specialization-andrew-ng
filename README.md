# Machine Learning Specilization with Andrew Ng
<p>
This repository contains a collection of notes and implementations of machine learning algorithms from Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization.
The specialization consists of three courses:
</p>

1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

1. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

<p>
Implementations are completed using Jupyter Notebooks and Python.

## Notes
<p>
These notes are information I found helpful while studying through the curriculum. 
They include high level overviews, practical tips, and lots of walkthroughs through core mathematical concepts. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is that most of the course is covered using these notes in conjunction with the assignments.
Though, I highly suggest using Andrew's video series (free) and optional labs (paid), as he does a fantastic job of teaching.
</p>
<p>
I originally wrote these notes in Notion, which I've provided links for, but I've also added PDF versions for accessibility. I suggest working through the collection in the order they are provided, as much of the knowledge builds upon itself.
